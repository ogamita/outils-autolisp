# POSIX sh — print the provenance manifest for one install/release phase.
#
#   sh scripts/make-manifest.sh <phase> > <staged-tree>/share/doc/<project>/manifest-<phase>.txt
#
# Canonical copy:
#   https://gitlab.com/informatimago/rules/-/blob/master/scripts/make-manifest.sh
# Rules it implements: build-rules.md § 7, version-rules.md (tag names).
# Fix it there, then re-vendor; do not diverge the copies.
#
# <phase> is a build phase name — programs | libraries | documentation |
# sources, or whatever a project's phases are called. Each staged tree
# gets its OWN manifest, because phases are staged and installed
# separately (CI often installs programs only; documentation may be
# rendered later on another host). One shared file would quietly
# describe whichever phase was installed last.
#
# The manifest answers "which commit is this tree built from", which no
# other installed file does: release notes describe a feature set, and a
# version stamp is shared by every commit between two releases.
# `release:' names the release tag when HEAD sits exactly on one;
# otherwise it says how far past the last release the build is — exactly
# the case where reading a version number misleads.
#
# Project-specific bits, both optional:
#
#   MANIFEST_PROJECT      project name (default: the work tree's basename)
#   MANIFEST_VERSIONS_CMD command printing "name version, name version"
#                         for the shipped programs
#                         (default: scripts/manifest-versions.sh if executable)
#
# Run from the top of the work tree. Outside a git checkout — a build
# from an unpacked source tarball — it falls back to the
# manifest-sources.txt that the source-packaging target put at the
# tarball root, so provenance survives the trip through the tarball.
